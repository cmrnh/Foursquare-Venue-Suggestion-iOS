## Synopsis

A simple iOS implementation using Foursquare to suggest venues near a location (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/suggestcompletion) based on a user-input query string. The code performs an additional string-based filter on the Foursquare results as the user types to reduce API calls.

## How to Run

Before running on the simulator or an iOS device, copy the client ID and client secret for the app you registered at developer.foursquare.com into BBFoursquareRequestManager.m
